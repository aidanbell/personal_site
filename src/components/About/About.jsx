      <p>Welcome to my site</p>
      <p>
        Curious and detail-oriented, I tend to approach problems with
        creativity and efficiency first, and enjoy tinkering with the latest
        technologies. After studying literature and poetry, I recognized that
        my enjoyment of deconstructing and analyzing large pieces of writing
        was mirrored in the world of programming. I view my place in the field
        of software engineering as one in which I have room to grow, and
        satiate my desire to never stop learning.
